# Data Analysis and Management Using MongoDB: 
# A Case Study of UK Food Establishments

___

## Summary of Analysis:

### 1. Data Import and Setup:

* The data was imported into a MongoDB database named uk_food, with a collection named establishments. This setup was completed using the mongoimport command in a terminal environment.
* The database and collections were then verified and accessed through a Python script using the pymongo library, which facilitated interaction with the NoSQL database.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

* The analysis included querying the database for specific conditions, such as establishments with a hygiene score of 20 and those in London with a RatingValue greater than or equal to 4.
* Queries were constructed using MongoDB's query language, and the results were retrieved and converted into Pandas DataFrames for further manipulation and display.
* The analysis also involved counting the number of documents that matched the criteria and displaying relevant fields for inspection.

### 3. Data Manipulation and Visualization:

* The data was filtered and converted into DataFrames, allowing for easy manipulation and visualization using Pandas.
* Insights were derived from the data by displaying and analyzing specific fields, which helped in understanding the distribution and characteristics of the establishments based on hygiene scores and ratings.

### 4. Key Skills Utilized:
* **MongoDB Querying:** Skills in constructing and executing MongoDB queries to retrieve and manipulate data from a NoSQL database.
* **Data Import and Database Management:** Expertise in setting up and managing a database using MongoDB, including importing JSON data and verifying database and collection integrity.
* **Python Programming:** Proficiency in Python, particularly using libraries such as pymongo for database interaction and pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Ability to conduct EDA, including querying data, counting documents, and converting data into a structured format for further analysis.
* **Data Analysis and Interpretation:** Skills in analyzing the output from database queries, interpreting the results, and drawing meaningful insights from the data.
